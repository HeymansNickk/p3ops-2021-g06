# DNS Automation Research

## General

Research on how to use the dedicated config files so that the correct zones and records  
are added to the dns server on CentOS. Before reading this, I recommend reading the DNS  
research file.

## Versions

* CentOS: 8.2
* DNS: bertvv.bind

## Understanding the configuration file

* Example:
```
bind_zones:
  # Example of a primary zone (hosts: and name_servers: ares defined)
  - name: CORONA2020.local       # Domain name
    type: primary
    allow_update: ['any']
    create_reverse_zones: true  # Skip creation of reverse zones
    primaries:
      - 192.100.100.195                # Primary server(s) for this zone
    name_servers:
      - bravo
      - golf
    hosts:
      - name: alfa
        ip: 192.100.100.194
        aliases:
          - dc
      - name: bravo
        ip: 192.100.100.195
        aliases:
          - dns
      - name: charlie
        ip: 192.100.100.198
        aliases:
          - www
      - name: delta
        ip: 192.100.100.199
        aliases:
          - mail
      - name: echo
        ip: 192.100.100.200
        aliases:
          - sccm
      - name: golf
        ip: 192.100.100.196
        aliases:
          - secDns
      - name: work             # This IP is in another subnet, will result in
        ip: 192.100.100.0             #   multiple reverse zones
      - name: guest
        ip: 192.100.100.128
    networks:
      - '192.100.100'
    mail_servers:
      - name: delta
        preference: 10
```

The code above will generate two zone files, a forward one and a reverse one.  
Next to adding it in that config file it will create the following zone files:

### Forward zone
